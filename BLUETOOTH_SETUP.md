# üîä Bluetooth Speaker Setup for Raspberry Pi

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Put Your Speaker in Pairing Mode
- Turn on your Bluetooth speaker
- Press and hold the Bluetooth/pairing button until it blinks
- Keep it close to the Raspberry Pi (within 3 feet)

### Step 2: Connect via Command Line (Easiest Method)

```bash
# Start Bluetooth control
bluetoothctl

# Once in bluetoothctl prompt:
power on
agent on
default-agent
scan on

# Wait for your speaker to appear (look for its name)
# Note the MAC address (looks like: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)

# Once you see your speaker, stop scanning
scan off

# Pair with your speaker (replace XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX with actual MAC)
pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Trust the device (so it auto-connects in future)
trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Connect to the device
connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Exit bluetoothctl
exit
```

### Step 3: Set Bluetooth as Default Audio Output

```bash
# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth

# Start PulseAudio
pulseaudio --start

# Set Bluetooth as default output
pactl set-default-sink bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX.a2dp_sink
# (Replace XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX with your speaker's MAC using underscores)
```

### Step 4: Test the Audio

```bash
# Test with speaker-test
speaker-test -t wav -c 2

# Or test with a sound file
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

## üéØ Alternative Method: Using GUI

If you have desktop environment:

1. **Open Bluetooth Settings**
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   # Navigate to: System Options ‚Üí Boot / Auto Login
   # Select: Desktop or Desktop Autologin (if not already)
   ```

2. **Use Bluetooth Icon**
   - Click Bluetooth icon in taskbar (top-right)
   - Click "Add Device..."
   - Select your speaker from the list
   - Click "Pair"
   - Right-click Bluetooth icon ‚Üí "Connect to Audio Device"

## üîß Automated Setup Script

I'll create a helper script for you:

```bash
# Save this as connect-bluetooth-speaker.sh
bash connect-bluetooth-speaker.sh
```

This will guide you through the process interactively.

## üéõÔ∏è Setting Default Audio Output

### Check Available Audio Outputs

```bash
# List all audio sinks
pactl list short sinks

# You'll see something like:
# 0  alsa_output.platform-bcm2835_audio.analog-stereo  (3.5mm jack)
# 1  bluez_sink.AA_BB_CC_DD_EE_FF.a2dp_sink           (Bluetooth)
```

### Set Bluetooth as Default

```bash
# Method 1: Using pactl (temporary - until reboot)
pactl set-default-sink bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX.a2dp_sink

# Method 2: Make it permanent
echo "set-default-sink bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX.a2dp_sink" >> ~/.config/pulse/default.pa
```

---

## üîÑ Auto-Connect on Boot

### Make Bluetooth Auto-Connect

```bash
# Edit Bluetooth service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bt-agent.service
```

Add this content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Bluetooth Auth Agent
After=bluetooth.service
PartOf=bluetooth.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bluetoothctl -- agent on
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/bluetoothctl -- default-agent

[Install]
WantedBy=bluetooth.target
```

Enable it:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable bt-agent.service
sudo systemctl start bt-agent.service
```

## üìã Complete Setup Script

Run this one-time setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete Bluetooth Audio Setup

echo "üîä Bluetooth Speaker Setup for HomePi"
echo "====================================="
echo ""

# Install required packages
echo "Installing PulseAudio and Bluetooth modules..."
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth bluez

# Start Bluetooth service
echo "Starting Bluetooth service..."
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth

# Start PulseAudio
echo "Starting PulseAudio..."
pulseaudio --start

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Setup complete!"
echo ""
echo "Now run: bash connect-bluetooth-speaker.sh"
echo "to connect your speaker."
```

## üéµ Testing HomePi with Bluetooth Speaker

After connecting your speaker:

```bash
# Start HomePi
cd ~/homepi
bash start.sh

# Open web interface
# Try playing a song
# Audio should come from your Bluetooth speaker!
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Speaker Not Found During Scan?

```bash
# Restart Bluetooth service
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

# Make sure speaker is in pairing mode
# Try scanning again
```

### Audio Not Coming from Speaker?

```bash
# Check audio routing
pactl list short sinks

# Make sure Bluetooth sink is default
pactl set-default-sink bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX.a2dp_sink

# Check volume
pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ 70%
```

### Connection Drops?

```bash
# Increase Bluetooth power
sudo hciconfig hci0 class 0x200428

# Edit Bluetooth config
sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf

# Add/modify these lines:
[General]
DiscoverableTimeout = 0
PairableTimeout = 0
```

### No Sound in HomePi?

Make sure PulseAudio is running:
```bash
# Check status
pulseaudio --check || echo "Not running"

# Start it
pulseaudio --start

# Restart HomePi
```

## üéØ Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Connect to speaker
bluetoothctl connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Disconnect speaker
bluetoothctl disconnect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Check connection status
bluetoothctl info XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# List paired devices
bluetoothctl paired-devices

# Set volume
pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ 70%
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Keep Speaker Close**: During pairing, keep speaker within 3 feet
2. **Battery Level**: Check speaker battery before long sessions
3. **Auto-reconnect**: Once trusted, speaker should auto-connect on boot
4. **Volume Control**: Use both speaker's volume and web interface volume
5. **Range**: Bluetooth typically works up to 30 feet without obstacles

## üîã Power Saving

If you want to disable Bluetooth when not needed:

```bash
# Disable Bluetooth
sudo rfkill block bluetooth

# Enable Bluetooth
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
```

---

## üì± Multiple Speakers?

You can pair multiple speakers, but only one can be active at a time:

```bash
# Switch between speakers
bluetoothctl disconnect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  # Disconnect current
bluetoothctl connect YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY    # Connect to another
```
