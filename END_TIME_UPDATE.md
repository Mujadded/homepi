# Schedule End Time Feature

## ✅ What's New

Now every schedule shows **when the track will end**!

### Before:
```
07:00 • 🎵 Morning_Song.mp3 • ⏱️ 3:24
```

### After:
```
07:00 → 07:03 • 🎵 Morning_Song.mp3 • ⏱️ 3:24
```

## 🎯 Visual Examples

### List View:
```
Morning Alarm
✅ Active

07:00 → 07:03 • 🎵 Wake_Up.mp3 • ⏱️ 3:24 • 🔊 80% • 📅 MON, WED, FRI
```

### Calendar View:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 07:00                                       │
│ ──────────────────────────────────────────  │
│                                             │
│ 07:00 → 07:03 - Morning Alarm              │
│ 🎵 Wake_Up.mp3 • ⏱️ 3:24 • 🔊 80%          │
│ 📅 MON, WED, FRI                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### With Repeat (Loops Forever):
```
07:00 → ♾️ Loops Forever • 🎵 Alarm.mp3 • ⏱️ 2:30
```

## 🔍 Conflict Detection Made Easy

Now you can instantly see if schedules overlap!

### ✅ Good Spacing:
```
Schedule 1: 07:00 → 07:03  (Morning Song)
Schedule 2: 07:10 → 07:13  (Next Song)

✅ 7-minute gap between them!
```

### ⚠️ Potential Conflict:
```
Schedule 1: 07:00 → 07:05  (Long Song - 5:30)
Schedule 2: 07:05 → 07:08  (Next Song - 3:00)

⚠️ They start/end at same time - might be OK
```

### ❌ Clear Overlap:
```
Schedule 1: 07:00 → 07:06  (Song 1 - 5:30)
Schedule 2: 07:03 → 07:06  (Song 2 - 3:00)

❌ Song 2 starts while Song 1 is still playing!
```

## 🎨 Color Coding

- **Green** = Normal end time
- **Orange (♾️)** = Loops forever (repeat enabled)

## 💡 Smart Calculations

The end time is calculated automatically:
1. **Start Time** = When schedule is set (e.g., 07:00)
2. **+ Duration** = Length of the song (e.g., 3:24)
3. **= End Time** = When it will finish (e.g., 07:03)

**Notes:**
- Rounds up to nearest minute
- Handles midnight crossover (e.g., 23:58 → 00:02)
- Shows "Loops Forever" if repeat is enabled

## 📊 Benefits

### 1. Easy Schedule Planning
See at a glance when each track finishes so you can space them properly.

### 2. Conflict Detection
Spot overlapping schedules immediately without manual calculation.

### 3. Better Time Management
Know exactly how much time each schedule takes.

### 4. Visual Timeline
In calendar view, see the full flow of your day with start and end times.

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Calculation:**
```javascript
startMinutes = hour * 60 + minute
durationMinutes = ceil(duration / 60)  // Round up
endMinutes = startMinutes + durationMinutes
endHour = floor(endMinutes / 60) % 24  // Handle 24h wraparound
endMinute = endMinutes % 60
```

**Special Cases:**
- **No duration:** Shows nothing (just start time)
- **Repeat enabled:** Shows "♾️ Loops Forever"
- **Midnight crossover:** Handles correctly (e.g., 23:58 + 5min = 00:03)

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Morning Routine
```
06:00 → 06:03  Wake Up Song (3:24)
06:10 → 06:13  Morning Energy (2:45)
06:20 → 06:24  Breakfast Vibes (4:12)

✅ Perfect spacing - no overlaps!
```

### Example 2: Workout Session
```
17:00 → 17:04  Warm Up (4:30)
17:05 → 17:35  Workout Mix (30:00)
17:36 → 17:41  Cool Down (5:00)

✅ Seamless transitions!
```

### Example 3: Alarm Clock
```
07:00 → ♾️ Loops Forever  ALARM (2:30) - Repeat ON

⚠️ Will play on loop until manually stopped
```

### Example 4: Potential Conflict
```
12:00 → 12:15  Lunch Music (15:00)
12:10 → 12:13  Announcement (3:00)

❌ Conflict! Announcement starts at 12:10
   but Lunch Music doesn't end until 12:15
```
