# Final 4 Display Screens - Functional & Beautiful

## Overview

Your Sense HAT now has **4 perfectly functional screens** that provide real, useful information at a glance. Each screen is designed to be immediately understandable and visually appealing.

## The 4 Screens

### Screen 1: ⏳ Hourglass Countdown
**Shows: Time until next scheduled song**

#### What You See:
- **Hourglass shape** with animated sand
- **Sand in top chamber** = time remaining
- **Sand in bottom chamber** = time passed
- **Sand falls through middle** (animated)

#### Color Coding:
- 🔵 **Blue** = Plenty of time (>30 min)
- 🟠 **Orange** = Getting close (10-30 min)
- 🔴 **Red** = Urgent! (<10 min) - pulses when critical

#### How It Works:
- More time remaining = more sand in top
- Less time remaining = more sand in bottom
- Sand visually "falls" to show active countdown
- When <10 min, hourglass glows red urgently

#### No Schedule:
- Shows ✅ **green checkmark** when no songs scheduled

---

### Screen 2: 🎵 Music Visualizer + Progress
**Shows: Playing status and song progress**

#### When Playing:
- **Top 6 rows:** Animated audio visualizer
  - 8 columns of bouncing bars
  - Green (bottom) → Yellow (middle) → Orange (top)
  - Bars dance at different frequencies
  - Simulates real audio spectrum

- **Bottom row:** Song progress bar
  - 🔵 Blue = completed portion
  - Gray = remaining portion
  - Fills left to right as song plays

#### When Not Playing:
- Shows ⏸️ **gray pause icon**

#### Real-Time Updates:
- Progress bar updates every second
- Shows exactly how much of song is left
- Visualizer provides engaging animation

### Screen 3: ❤️ Temperature Heart
**Shows: Room temperature via heart color**

#### Heart Colors:
- 🧊 **Bright Blue** = Very cold (<16°C / 61°F)
- 💙 **Light Blue** = Cold (16-18°C / 61-64°F)
- 💚 **Cyan** = Cool (18-22°C / 64-72°F)
- 💛 **Green/Yellow** = Comfortable (22-26°C / 72-79°F)
- 🧡 **Orange** = Warm (26-28°C / 79-82°F)
- ❤️ **Red** = Hot (>28°C / 82°F)

#### Features:
- Heart **pulses** gently (like a heartbeat)
- Color instantly tells you room temperature
- No numbers needed - intuitive at a glance
- Pulse intensity changes with temperature

#### Use Cases:
- Quick room temp check without looking at numbers
- Know if you should adjust heating/cooling
- Perfect nighttime temperature monitoring

### Screen 4: 💧 Humidity Droplet
**Shows: Room humidity percentage**

#### What You See:
- **Water droplet shape**
- **Fills from bottom to top** based on humidity
- Empty outline = 0% humidity
- Completely filled = 100% humidity

#### Fill Levels:
- **Empty (just outline)** = Very dry (<12%)
- **Quarter filled** = Dry (12-37%)
- **Half filled** = Comfortable (37-62%)
- **Three-quarters filled** = Humid (62-87%)
- **Completely filled** = Very humid (>87%)

#### Colors:
- 💙 **Bright blue** = filled portion
- 🌑 **Dim blue** = empty outline
- Easy to see fill level at a glance

#### Use Cases:
- Monitor dry air in winter (add humidifier if low)
- Check excess humidity in summer (use dehumidifier if high)
- Optimal range: 40-60% (droplet about half full)
